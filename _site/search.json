Figure 1 illustrates the Dodgers’ team rolling xwOBA from the start of the season throughout mid May for both 2024 and 2025.\nWe can see that the 2025 Dodgers started the season significantly hotter offensively compared to 2024, based on expected wOBA. However, their performance has dipped recently, bringing their rolling xwOBA closer to their 2024 levels around the same point in the season. Both years show the Dodgers performing well above the 2025 league average xwOBA.\nWill the rest of 2025 look like 2024?\n\n\nCode\n# data load and prep\nxwoba_2025 = \"data/team-xwoba-2025.csv\"\nxwoba_2024 = \"data/team-xwoba-2024.csv\"\ndf_2025 = process_baseball_data(xwoba_2025, 2025, end_date_str=\"2025-05-03\")\ndf_2024 = process_baseball_data(xwoba_2024, 2024, end_date_str=\"2024-10-01\")\n\ndf = pd.concat([df_2025, df_2024], ignore_index=True)\ndf[\"Plot Date\"] = df['Game Date'].apply(\n    lambda dt: pd.Timestamp(year=REFERENCE_YEAR, month=dt.month, day=dt.day)\n)\ndf[\"Year\"] = df[\"Game Date\"].dt.year\ndf = df.sort_values(by=\"Plot Date\")\n\nfig = px.line(df, x=\"Plot Date\", y=\"Rolling XWOBA\", color=\"Year\", markers=True,\n    color_discrete_sequence=['blue', 'orange'])\n\nleague_average_xwoba_2024 = 0.312\nfig.add_hline(y=league_average_xwoba_2024,\n    line_dash=\"dash\",\n    line_color=\"red\",\n    annotation_text=f\"2024 MLB Avg XWOBA ({league_average_xwoba_2024})\",\n    annotation_position=\"bottom right\")\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title='Game Date',\n    yaxis_title='Rolling XWOBA',\n    hovermode='x unified',\n    title=\"Dodgers xwOBA (2024 vs 2025)\"\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nFigure 2: Team XWOBA 2024\n\n\n\n\nLet’s sure hope we do not witness another late-May struggle.\n\n\nShohei Ohtani\nWhile the team’s overall offensive performance has shown some regression towards 2024 levels, it’s important to look at individual player contributions. Let’s examine Shohei Ohtani’s rolling xwOBA as an example.\n\nI am hedging my bets that Ohtani will win NL MVP again. Observe that Ohtani exhibits cylical patterns in his rolling xwOBA.\n\nIn 2021, Ohtani brandished an above 0.500 xwOBA during the summer months of the season. In 2021, writes a similar story to 2021 with the addition of a 1.0 OPS in August. Last year, a year unlike any other, Ohtani wins MVP, concluding his 2024 campaign with a 1.225 OPS in September and October.\nAre we due for another Shohei Summer?\nI rooting for it. However, with Ohtani pitching on the horizon after the all-star break, it will interesting to see how that will influence with offensive performance heading into the fall. 2023 Ohtani was as close as we will ever get to the most athletically impressive season in all of baseball. His batting slash line was .304/.412/.654 and boasted a 142 ERA+ on the season. Unfortunately, Ohtani had a season ending injury in his throwing elbow in 2023.\nIs this symbolic of Icarsus’s Hubris? 2025, 2026, and 2027 will determine if Ohtani is Icarsus or a living God, standing among mere mortals. With only half a season of pitching, it is unkliekly Ohtani will garner any Cy Young votes. However, a full season of pitching, alongside a 1.0 OPS, will cement Ohtani as the greatest of all time."

    "text": "There is no denying that baseball has an element of luck. Sometimes the hardest hit balls find a glove, and sometimes a blooper falls in for a hit. We can try to quantify this luck by looking at the difference between a player’s actual stats and their expected stats.\n\nExpected Batting Average (xBA)\nFirst let’s take a look at expected batting average (xBA). We grab the latest expected statistics leaderboard from baseball savant.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"expected_stats.csv\")\ndf[\"est_ba_minus_ba_diff\"].describe().round(4)\n\n\ncount    251.0000\nmean      -0.0069\nstd        0.0283\nmin       -0.0750\n25%       -0.0260\n50%       -0.0060\n75%        0.0125\nmax        0.0660\nName: est_ba_minus_ba_diff, dtype: float64\n\n\nThe unluckiest batter has as a difference of -0.075, while the luckiest batter has a difference of 0.066. As it stands, Joc Pederson of the Texas Ranges holds unluckiest BA and Pavin Smith of the Arizona Diamondbacks boasts the luckiest BA. Interestingly, the mean xBA is -0.0069, suggesting that the average MLB hitter (with the minimum number of BIP/PA) is slightly unlucky when it comes to batting average.\n\n\nAbove shows Joc Pederson lining out to Samad Taylor. The batted ball had a hit probability of 78% per baseballsavant. Conversely, Pavin Smith’s single to Hyeseong Kim had a 94% chance of becoming an out.\n\n\nPederson and Smith are just two players on difference ends of the spectrum. Here is a histogram, illustrating the disitrbution of expected batting average differences. Oberve the slight left-skew distribution.\n\n\nCode\nimport plotly.express as px\nfig =  px.histogram(df, x=\"est_ba_minus_ba_diff\", marginal=\"rug\", hover_data=[\"last_name, first_name\"],\n    labels = {\n        \"est_ba_minus_ba_diff\": \"BA - xBA\",\n        \"count\": \"Count\"\n    },\n    title=\"Distribution of xBA Difference\"\n)\nfig.show()\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nPretty close correlation between xBA and BA with an \\(R^2\\) value of 0.48. xBA is not a perfect indicator of BA. In fact, xBA should be interpreted more heavily than BA given that it removes luck from the at-bat. Note that there remains a sizable discrepancy between xBA and BA, suggesting a sizable “luck” component observed in BA that xBA does not capture.\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\n\nfig = px.scatter(df, x=\"est_ba\", y=\"ba\", hover_data=[\"last_name, first_name\"], trendline=\"ols\",\n    labels = {\n        \"est_ba\": \"xBA\",\n        \"ba\": \"BA\"\n    },\n    title=\"Relationship Between xBA and BA\"\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\n\nExpected Weighted OBA (xwOBA)\nxwOBA is what statcast considers, the most important offensive metric that tells “the story of a player’s season based on the quality of and amount of contact, not coutomes.” In sum, xwOBA weighs hit types and walks with an expected run value based on historically similar batted ball events. The formulation of the coefficients use exit velocity, launch angle, and sprint speed (for topped or weakly hit balls).\n\n\nCode\ndf[\"est_woba_minus_woba_diff\"].describe().round(4)\n\n\ncount    251.0000\nmean      -0.0107\nstd        0.0313\nmin       -0.0940\n25%       -0.0300\n50%       -0.0110\n75%        0.0130\nmax        0.0580\nName: est_woba_minus_woba_diff, dtype: float64\n\n\nThe mean wOBA-xwOBA difference is -0.0107. This is surpsignly greater than the mean difference of BA and xBA. In addition, the most unlucky batter with xwOBA is most unlucky than the most unlucky batter with xBA. Simiarly, the most lucky xwOBA batter is not as lucky as the most lucky xBA batter. Overall it seems like player are less lucky with xwOBA. A reason for this discrepency is that xwOBA weighs batted ball events with difference values. For example, a double is weighted more heavily than a single. As such a batted ball who’s exit velocity and launch angle that would likely result in a double will increase the diffence in xwOBA and wOBA if that double becomes a single.\n\n\nCode\nfig =  px.histogram(df, x=\"est_woba_minus_woba_diff\", marginal=\"rug\", hover_data=[\"last_name, first_name\"], \n        labels = {\n        \"diff\": \"wOBA - xwOBA\",\n        \"count\": \"Count\"\n    },\n    title=\"Distribution of wOBA-xwOBA\")\nfig.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\n\nCombining Differences\n\n\nCode\nid_cols = ['last_name, first_name', 'player_id', 'pa', 'year']\n\n# melt the three diff-cols into long form\ndf_long = df.melt(\n    id_vars=id_cols,\n    value_vars=[\n        'est_ba_minus_ba_diff',\n        'est_slg_minus_slg_diff',\n        'est_woba_minus_woba_diff'\n    ],\n    var_name='metric',\n    value_name='diff'\n)\n# map the verbose column names to simple metric labels\ndf_long['metric'] = df_long['metric'].map({\n    'est_ba_minus_ba_diff':   'BA',\n    'est_slg_minus_slg_diff': 'SLG',\n    'est_woba_minus_woba_diff':'wOBA'\n})\n\nfig = px.histogram(df_long, x=\"diff\", color=\"metric\", marginal=\"rug\", hover_data=[\"last_name, first_name\"], \n        labels = {\n        \"diff\": \"Metric - Expected Metric\",\n        \"count\": \"Count\"\n    },\n    title=\"Distribution of xBA, xSLG, and xwOBA Differences\"\n)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nObserve the histogram above that combines xBA, expected slugging (xSLG), and xwOBA. Among xBA, xSLG, and xwOBA, xSLG shows the greated spread in difference values. This is likely a result of how SLG assign weights to hits. Specifically, SLG is defined as (1B + 2Bx2 + 3Bx3 + HRx4)/AB. Unlike, wOBA, slugging weights are fixed and higher-valued. Hence, a batted ball that does not result in its expected outcome faces a greater difference penalty.\nWho’s that unlucky slugger to the very left? That’s Royals veteran Salvador Perez.\n\n\nThat ball had a 97% hit probability and would have been a homerun in 9/30 ballparks.\nSalvador Pérez’s recent flyout underscores the value of integrating ballpark- and weather-specific factors into our expected-stat models. Although current metrics leverage historical launch-angle and exit-velocity data to predict outcomes, they omit critical dimensions—namely batted-ball trajectory, precise horizontal launch direction, and wind conditions. In Pérez’s case, a strong tailwind or a gust toward the wall might readily have turned that routine out into a home run. That said, Statcast remains an extraordinary tool for quantifying the game, and enriching it with environmental and park-design variables promises even deeper insights into batted-ball performance.\nThanks for reading!"
