    "text": "The Dodgers, defending World Series champs, entered 2025 with sky-high expectations. How are they measuring up about 33 games in?\nAs of early May, they boast a stellar 23-10 (.697) record, sitting atop the NL West with a 1.5-game lead over the Padres. They’re currently riding a 7-game win streak.\n\nNL West Standings\n\n\nTeam\nW\nL\nPCT\nL10\n\n\n\n\nDodgers\n23\n11\n0.676\n7-3\n\n\nPadres\n22\n11\n0.667\n6-4\n\n\nGiants\n22\n13\n0.629\n6-4\n\n\nDiamondbacks\n18\n16\n0.529\n4-6\n\n\nRockies\n6\n28\n0.176\n2-8\n\n\n\n\nOffense Comparison\nThey surpass their record from one year ago today, where they were 21-13 on May 3rd 2024.

However, their performance has dipped recently, bringing their rolling xwOBA closer to their 2024 levels around the same point in the season. Both years show the Dodgers performing well above the 2025 league average xwOBA.\nWill the rest of 2025 look like 2024?\n\n\nCode\ndf_2024 = process_baseball_data(xwoba_2024, 2024)\nfig = px.line(df_2024, x=\"Game Date\", y=\"Rolling XWOBA\", markers=True, color_discrete_sequence=['orange'])\n\nleague_average_xwoba_2024 = 0.312\nfig.add_hline(y=league_average_xwoba_2024,\n    line_dash=\"dash\",\n    line_color=\"red\",\n    annotation_text=f\"2024 MLB Avg XWOBA ({league_average_xwoba_2024})\",\n    annotation_position=\"bottom right\")\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nFigure 2: Team XWOBA 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShohei Ohtani\nWhile the team’s overall offensive performance has shown some regression towards 2024 levels, it’s important to look at individual player contributions. Let’s examine Shohei Ohtani’s rolling xwOBA as an example."
