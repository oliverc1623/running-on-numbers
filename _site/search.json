How are they measuring up about 33 games in?\nAs of early May, they boast a stellar 27-14 (.659) record, sitting atop the NL West with a 1-game lead over the Padres. They’re recently split a 4-game series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Dbacks could very well be a play-off opponent. A series split, coupled with a sub-0.500 record against winning teams, could orchestrate a rivertting play-off scene."
