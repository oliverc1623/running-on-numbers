The Dodgers, defending World Series champs, entered 2025 with sky-high expectations. How are they measuring up about 33 games in?

As of early May, they boast a stellar 23-10 (.697) record, sitting atop the NL West with a 1.5-game lead over the Padres. They're currently riding a 7-game win streak.

# Offense Comparison

They surpass their record from one year ago today, where they were 21-13 on May 3rd 2024. Let's see how their expected wOBA fares from last year.

@fig-team-xwoba illustrates the Dodgers' team rolling xwOBA from the start of the season throughout early May for both 2024 and 2025.

We can see that the 2025 Dodgers started the season significantly hotter offensively compared to 2024, based on expected wOBA. However, their performance has dipped recently, bringing their rolling xwOBA closer to their 2024 levels around the same point in the season. Both years show the Dodgers performing well above the 2025 league average xwOBA.

Will the rest of 2025 look like 2024?

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: fig-team-xwoba2024
#| fig-cap: "Team XWOBA 2024"

df_2024 = process_baseball_data(xwoba_2024, 2024)
fig = px.line(df_2024, x="Game Date", y="Rolling XWOBA", markers=True, color_discrete_sequence=['orange'])

league_average_xwoba_2024 = 0.312
fig.add_hline(y=league_average_xwoba_2024,
    line_dash="dash",
    line_color="red",

# Shohei Ohtani

While the team's overall offensive performance has shown some regression towards 2024 levels, it's important to look at individual player contributions. Let's examine Shohei Ohtani's rolling xwOBA as an example.
